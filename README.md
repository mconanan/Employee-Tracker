# Employee-Tracker
Module 12 Challenge; build a content management system from the command line.

First, a database was created called employee_db, and seeded with data. Then a connection was made to the mMysql database.

A switch case was used to create the first inquier prompt, which contains many diffrent functions in order to view or add data to the database.

Functions were then created to make arrays frpm table data so that they could be used as choices for the inquirer prompts to add a role, and to add an employee.

The answers were then used to inject new data into the database tables using nested .then functions.
